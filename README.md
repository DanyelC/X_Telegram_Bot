# X_Telegram_Bot
This bot was developed and created by Danyel Clinário. It is still in the testing phase, any suggestion is welcome! @DanyelC

============================================================================================================

My main idea focuses on the creation of 2 bots that coordinate the text-based game, with some interactive functions. Exodia is a powerful God, but he was imprisoned billions of years ago 
and will try to get you to help him. The story takes place in Oasis, a futuristic city that survived the fourth world war and has the most advanced technological tools.
This city allows a small connection between the players, which makes the game, at least, multiplayer.
The main question is (more than one, actually) :
- Does Exodia really need his help or is he trying to manipulate you?

- What are these mysterious powers that Exodia promises to give you if you perform a series of tasks for him?

- How many people did Exodia make this contract with?

- What happens if you to betray him?

Only time will tell you ...

==============================================

Current status: In development (Primary Phase)
- X_Exodia_Bot: In development
- X_Oasis_Bot: Not configured
- Multiplayer space: Not started
- Missions, tasks, storyline: Not started
- Environment (images, sounds and videos): Not started
- Weapons, combat system: Not started

==============================================

The road is long and tiring, but the reward is glorious.
